# RL-ShopSmartly-using-reinforced-Learning 

#Agenda:
When we want to purchase our monthly groceries, there are multiple store options with different prices and availability. There is also a cost attached to traveling to these stores. Using reinforcement learning, we model these variables to learn the best strategy to purchase all the items we want.

#Approach:
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process (MDP). It aims to teach an agent how to make decisions in an environment in order to maximize a cumulative reward over time. Q-learning is particularly suitable for problems where the environment is unknown to the agent, and it must learn through trial and error.

Creates the state space by considering all possible combinations of buying statuses for the given number of items.
(In the context of reinforcement learning or decision-making problems, a "state" refers to a specific situation or configuration that the system or agent can be in. The "state space" is the set of all possible states that the system can occupy. It represents the entire range of situations that the system might encounter.)
