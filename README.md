# RL-ShopSmartly-using-reinforced-Learning 

#Introduction:
When we want to purchase our monthly groceries, there are multiple store options with different prices and availability. There is also a cost attached to traveling to these stores. Using reinforcement learning, we model these variables to learn the best strategy to purchase all the items we want.

#Approach to the reinforced learning:
Technologies used in this project are Python using libraries like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, etc., and jupyter notebook.
We will use different distributions and reinforcement learning techniques in this project.
â€¢ Item availability model we will be using the Bernoulli Distribution method.

Using Q learning and a wide variety of graphics from matplotlib we can find differences between normal and Q learning.

#How to Run the Code:
using jupyter Notebook we execute the code we have written for the project.

#Specify the required version of Python:
python_version >= 3.6
